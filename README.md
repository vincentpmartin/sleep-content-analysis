Systematic Item Content and Overlap Analysis of Self-reported Multiple Sleep Disorders Screening Questionnaires in Adults. *Journal of Clinical Medicine*.

Furthermore, to give the community a useful tool that can be used by any clinicians without any knowledge of coding, we set up a ðŸ‘‰[Binder repository](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vincentpmartin/sleep-content-analysis/HEAD?labpath=jupyter_notebook_sleep_content_analysis.ipynb)ðŸ‘ˆ, guiding the reader to run the code in a fully online environemnent. 

## HTML files, tables and figures
The analyze files corresponding to the [current study](https://raw.githack.com/vincentpmartin/sleep-content-analysis/main/jupyter_notebook_sleep_content_analysis.html) is available in this repository. <br>
The figures and tables produced by this code are available in the [./tables_and_figures](./tables_and_figures) folder. 

If you want to customize the code or run the analysis on your own data, please read ðŸ‘‡ next Section ðŸ‘‡

## Generic content analysis

We did not limit to Sleep content analysis, and we set up a **generic content analysis** that can be ran on any dataset in this repository: [https://github.com/vincentpmartin/generic_content_analysis](https://github.com/vincentpmartin/generic_content_analysis).
